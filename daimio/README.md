This directory stores all of the earthshatteringly fun Daimio files that get concatenated down to daimio_composite.js.

The curious naming conventions are due to my antiquated "build on demand" technique, so for example 1_daimio.js will just be daimio.js once the packaging system is evolved. For now if you add things here be aware that they are processed in filename sorted order, and that that order may vary depending on your particular environment -- so use the composite file for safety.
