  <h1>Notes on the Sans-collatz automaton</h1>

  <pre>
Some findings from exploring a rather curious automaton.

Use the <a href="sans-collatz.html">interactive demo</a> to explore the automata.
That page also has several javascript functions you can
use from the console to calculate generations more quickly.
Here's an example transcript:

grid = [[3,2,2],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
  [Array[3], Array[3], Array[3]]
onetick(grid)
  [Array[3], Array[3], Array[3]]
JSON.stringify(grid)
  "[[10,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]"
showticks(grid, 3)
  [[5,4,4],[4,4,4],[4,4,4]]
  [[16,2,2],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
  [[3,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,1,1]]
solveticks(grid)
  Object {grid: "[[3,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,1,1]]", offset: 0, clength: 12, fprint: 0}
moreticks(grid, 2, 5)
  trying 2: Offset: 0 Cycle length: 348 Total: 0 Grid: [[52,1,10],[1,10,4],[10,4,3]]
  trying 3: Offset: 369 Cycle length: 3 Total: 0 Grid: [[4,4,4],[4,4,4],[4,4,4]]
  trying 4: Offset: 572 Cycle length: 52 Total: 0 Grid: [[3,24,3],[24,2,24],[3,24,3]]
JSON.stringify(grid)
  "[[3,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,1,1]]"



THOUGHTS:
With a single "active" element (i.e. not 1, 2, or 4) in your grid,
the only question is when you first are divisible by 8.
So in that case there are only three possible cycles,
all of which share the same entry point.
(Where the "entry point" to the cycle is the first element of the cycle to appear.)

Looking at the common entry points could be interesting -- for a given cycle, are there "inaccessible" elements?
Can we measure the likelihood of entering through a particular element? So far experimental evidence points to
certain elements as being much more likely starting points.

Cycles have rotation and reflection symmetries with other cycles, but they also have element-based symmetries.
In other words, given a particular cycle you should be able to generate new cycles of the same length that are
disjoint but follow a similar pattern, e.g. by 1-2-4 / 3-5 replacement. (Any actual examples?)

The offset is how many generationsÂ pass before settling into a pattern.
They appear to increase by a factor of 10^(N-1) with each successive grid step
(though note that like all observations here this is wildly speculative).
Is there any correlation between the shape of the initial grid and the offset?
Cycle lengths tend to be very small compared to offsets.
Is there any way of knowing in which cycle a grid will end short of calculating all the offsets?
Are the offsets "random" enough to be useful in some fashion?


These are found cycles with "bounce-back" style edges, and guesses at offset behavior.

2x2:
    2: [[5,5],[5,5]] // these 2 and 3 cycles are
    3: [[4,4],[4,4]] // common to all grid sizes
    4: [[4,3],[3,4]]
    8: [[4,4],[3,3]]
   12: [[4,5],[4,4]]
   24: [[5,3],[1,11]]
offset less than 200 for all orbits; order of 100

3x3:
   11: [[3,3,5],[3,3,5],[3,3,5]]
   12: [[3,2,2],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
       [[3,2,2],[2,2,2],[2,2,3]]
       [[3,4,3],[4,4,4],[3,4,3]]  // many independent cycles of equal length

       [[3,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2],[3,2,2,3]]  // 2->4, and 2->1 if 1 not adj 3
       [[3,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2]]  // well, sorta. [3,4,1,2] doesn't.
   87: [[2,4,4,3],[4,2,1,4],[4,1,2,4],[3,4,4,2]]
