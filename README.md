# Daimio is for lovers

Daimio is a language for making programmable web applications. Your users can extend your application in non-trivial ways, and share those extensions with other users.

The web is fantastic: it allows us to download and use applications from untrusted sources without worrying about compromising our systems. The browser is a lovely sandboxing system, and the applications we build in the browser are becoming increasingly sophisticated.

Desktop applications still win for customizability and extensibility, however. Spreadsheets, text editors, multiplayer games, and any application used to get real work done -- all of these require the ability to extend and customize both the interface and the functionality of the application. Daimio lets us do this on the web.

## Getting started

Clone this repo into a web-accessible directory. Then point your browser at
- tests/daimio.html
- demos/automata/excitebikes.html
- demos/goodideas.html

You'll need a copy of CodeMirror installed to prevent the test page from complaining. 

The website http://daimio.org contains documentation, tests and general information.

Thanks for trying Daimio!
